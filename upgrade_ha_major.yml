# upgrade_ha_major.yml - PAN-OS HA pair major version upgrade playbook.
#
# Description
# ===========
#
# Performs a major version upgrade (i.e. 8.1.12 -> 9.0.5) on a PAN-OS HA pair.  This playbook simply imports the other
# playbooks in this repository making up the parts of this process (content upgrade, download base image, install 
# target version).
#
# This playbook requires connection details for the two members of the HA pair to be specified in the variables 
# 'primary_ip_address', 'secondary_ip_address', 'username', and 'password'.  These may be defined as host variables
# (see `host_vars/ha_pair.yml` for an example) or extra vars.
#
# Usage
# =====
#
# Required variables:
#
#   target: Target HA pair.  See `host_vars/ha_pair.yml` for sample definition of host variables.
#
#   base_version: Base version downloaded to both members of the HA pair.  This version is not installed
#                 (for example, the 9.0.0 base image in the 8.1.12 -> 9.0.5 upgrade process).
#
#   target_version: Version of PAN-OS to ultimately install on both members of the HA pair
#                   (for example, 9.0.5 in the 8.1.12 -> 9.0.5 upgrade process).
#
# See the VARS section of the playbook for additional customization options.
#
# Default run:
#
#  $ ansible-playbook -i inventory upgrade_ha_major.yml --extra-vars "target=ha_pair base_version=9.0.0 target_version=9.0.5"
#
# Notes
# =====
#
# HA pairs with preemption enabled are not supported by these playbooks.
